#db design

'''Driving down the road, you see some random people waiting for someone 
to pick them up and ask them to do some paid work.
 There has got to be a better way. You decide to write an app to assist with this problem. 
You as a user would log into the app with some informal work you need to
have done. Eg. Painting, tiling, building etc. You make an offer for
the amount you will pay for the work and the date you require the worker for.
An informal worker will be assigned to you (by a third party) that has the needed skill 
you need and is available on the selected date. The phones GPS picks up your location and 
assigns the closest qualified worker to do your work. Once the work is complete, the amount is 
subtracted from your credit card and you are asked to rate and comment the worker. The worker 
would get a FNB cashback number or a code to receive the payment at Checkers or Pick â€˜n Pay. Design 
a database for the solution. User profiles, jobs, workers etc. You do not need to consider API calls. 
You would like to keep stats on the workers, amount paid, work done.'''
